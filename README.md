## Samples contains a few patters where following practices are demonstrated:

### 1- Replacing branching in code:
       Replacing if-then-else conctruct with states (classes) that drives the decison making, sample uses 
       a simple Account balance managment scenario and handles different account states as frozen, closed 
       & active.
       
### 2- Replacing loops in code:    
       Sample takes a collection of Painters a shows how a linq query can be used to replacing looping, sample
       uses Painters selection scenario to find available, cheapest & fastest painter(s) from a collection 
       of painter.
